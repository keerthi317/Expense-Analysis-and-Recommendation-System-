Project Title: Expense Analyzer and Recommendation System

1. Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze user expenses and provide meaningful insights and recommendations to help users manage their finances efficiently.
The system processes expense data, identifies spending patterns, and supports better financial decision-making.

2. Objective
To analyze daily/monthly expenses
To understand spending behavior
To provide recommendations for better expense management

3. Problem Statement
Managing expenses manually is difficult and error-prone.
Users often lack clarity on where their money is spent and how to optimize savings.
This project aims to solve that problem using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

4. Proposed Solution
The Expense Analyzer:
Takes expense data as input
Cleans and processes the data
Analyzes spending patterns
Generates insights and recommendations
Machine learning models are used to improve prediction and categorization accuracy.

5. Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Visual Studio / Google Colab

6. Algorithms Used
Linear Regression (for expense trend prediction)
Random Forest Classifier (for expense categorization and recommendations)

7. Features
Expense data analysis
Category-wise spending insights
Visual representation of expenses
Recommendation generation

8. Dataset
The dataset contains expense-related attributes such as:
Date
Category
Amount
Description
(Source: Kaggle / User-collected data)

9. Conclusion
